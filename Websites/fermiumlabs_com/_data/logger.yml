      NNG Logger (Next Next Generation logger) is a datalogging software that can interface with any USB device based on the open source [data-chan](https://github.com/fermiumlabs/data-chan){:.dclink} framework. 
      The User interface is simple to use and intuitive, based on modern web technologies. It scales across a broad range of devices: Desktop PCs, Windows tablets, Projectors, small laptops... 
      
      Companies that wish to do so, can quickly develop and extend the interface to connect with their hardware.
