  description: "
  You can't know what is gonna break before it does.<br>If something slows down you may notice - but finding the issue:<br>
  That's another matter. <br> <br>
  You can't be inside every machine, every system of your factory.<br> <br>
  Humans are not omnipresent.<br>
  This is why we're building Houston.<br> <br>
  Houston is an integrated *hardware-software* solution. <br>
  Conceived for complex machinery systems and their environments: <br>
  From small production lines to **entire** factories. <br>
