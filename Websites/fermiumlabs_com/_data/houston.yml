        The key to connect quickly to partially-unkown hardware is being able to iterate fast.
        Write, test, **make mistakes as efficiently as possible**.

        **Houston** nodes can connect to almost anything with wires. Modbus PLCs, networked controllers, RS485 legacy devices, analog sensors, OPC-UA SCADA interfaces and HMIs.

        **Houston** allows you to search through your data in seconds.
        See your whole production plant across time, and just click your way through untill you isolate the problem.

        **Houston** search tecnology is used in datacenters to filter through **thousands** of server's historical logs.

        It will handle a few parallel production lines.

          * Which fluctuations in our manufacturing line are causing our products to fail?
          * How are our employees influencing the manufacturing process?
          * Can we increase manufacturing tolerances without decreasing quality?
          * What's causing our machine's downtime?
          * What's causing our products to fail prematurely after a few months?

        **Houston** supports both the R language and Python for data science, two of the most commonly adopted languages in European and US STEM degrees.
        You will be able to hire fresh and skilled minds, and get them to work straight away.

          [OPC-UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture) [IEC 62541](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/21987) is the leading standard in industrial automation.

          OPC-UA fixes the drawbacks of its long-live predecessor, OPC. It's more secure, cross platform and scalable.

          **Houston** Device include full native support for the OPC-UA protocol, as well as a suite of complimentary software to discover and manage OPC-UA devices.
