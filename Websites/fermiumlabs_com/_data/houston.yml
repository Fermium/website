        Houston devices can connect to almost anything with wires. Modbus PLCs, networked controllers, RS485 legacy devices.
        Analog sensors are covered as well through an ADC/DAC expansion.

        The key to connect quickly to partially-unkown hardware is being able to iterate fast.
        Write, test, **make mistakes as efficiently as possible**.

        Houston allows you to search through your data in seconds.
        See your whole production plant across time, and just click your way through untill you isolate the problem.


        Houston search tecnology is used in datacenters to filter through thousands of server's historical logs.

        It will handle a few parallel production lines.

        With a complete sets of Data Science tools any trained Statistician, Engineer, Matematician or Programmer can extract serious insigts from the behaviour of your plant.

          * Which fluctuations in our manufacturing line are causing our products to fail?
          * How are our employees influencing the manufacturing process?
          * Can we increase manufacturing tolerances without decreasing quality?

        Houston supports both the R language and Python for data science, two of the most commonly adopted languages in European and US STEM degrees.
        So you can hire fresh and skilled minds, and get them to work straight away.

          Modbus may be the most important industrial comunication protocol, in particular for it's capability to read registers from legacy PLCs that do not support OPC-UA.

          Houston supports the following ModBus variants:

            {:.bullet-list}

            * Modbus over TCP

          [OPC-UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture) [IEC 62541](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/21987) is the leading standard in industrial automation.

          OPC-UA fixes the drawbacks of its long-live predecessor, OPC. It's more secure, cross platform and scalable.

          Houston Device include full native support for the OPC-UA protocol, as well as a suite of complimentary software to discover and manage OPC-UA devices.
