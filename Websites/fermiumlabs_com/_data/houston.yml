      Houston devices can connect to almost anything digital with wires. Modbus PLCs, networked controllers, RS485 legacy devices.
      Analog sensors are covered as well through an ADC/DAC expansion.

      The key to connect quickly to partially-unkown hardware is being able to iterate fast. In Houston, the code you write can be executed istantaneusly, one piece at a time.

        description  : |
          Modbus may be the most important industrial comunication protocol, in particular for it's capability to read registers from legacy PLCs that do not support OPC-UA.

          Houston supports the following ModBus variants:

            * Modbus over TCP
            * Modbus over UDP
            * Modbus over Serial
              * ASCII (for legacy applications)
              * RTU
              * Binary

          [OPC-UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture) [IEC 62541](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/21987) is the leading standard in industrial automation.

          OPC-UA fixes the drawbacks of its long-live predecessor, OPC. It's more secure, cross platform and scalable.

          Houston Device include full native support for the OPC-UA protocol, as well as a suite of complimentary software to discover and manage OPC-UA devices.

          Many modern industrial devices expose themselves through HTTP APIs.

          Houston supports all APIs implemented through official HTTP standards.
