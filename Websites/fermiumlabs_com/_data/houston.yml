          [OPC-UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture) [IEC 62541](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/21987) is the leading standard in industrial automation.
          
          OPC-UA fixes the drawbacks of its long-live predecessor, OPC. It's more secure, cross platform and scalable.
          
          Houston Device include full native support for the OPC-UA protocol.
